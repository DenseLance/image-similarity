Oh no! Zhong Xina lost all his social credit and he needs your help to get them back. To help Zhong, all you need to do is to take the <a href = "http://77e5-2406-3003-206f-4bd3-8582-32b0-81fc-2a6.ngrok.io/">social credit test</a> for him. The examiner told him to submit a picture of the original artist who sang one of the songs found <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KU41dey4YYI">here</a>. The picture can be found on China's Wikipedia.

<b>Hint:</b> You can always retake the test. If you obtain a score that is abnormally high but is still considered as a fail, it may mean that you are on the right track.

## Challenge Creation Process

I used the <a href = "https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~cslzhang/IQA/TIP_IQA_FSIM.pdf">Feature-Similarity Index Metric (FSIM) </a> to determine whether the image sent by the user is visually similar to the original image.
